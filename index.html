   <h1>Discover Your Child’s Natural Intelligence Through Scientific Brain Mapping</h1>

   <p>Sristi BrainArk guides individuals—especially children aged 3 years and above—in discovering their inborn intelligence and core strengths through Genetic Brain Profiling (GBP) powered by MiDNA Global. Our assessment is based on a scientific approach that maps the connection between fingerprints and the neural cortex. This powerful tool helps parents, educators, and professionals unlock natural talents, learning styles, and natural potential. We believe every child is born unique and deserves to grow with confidence in their skills, personality, and career choices.

Our Aim: To bring this science to the grassroots level, empowering parents to make informed decisions about their child’s education, curriculum, and career path—based not on assumptions, but on scientific awareness of their natural abilities. </p>
